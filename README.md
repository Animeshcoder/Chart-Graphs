Project: Student Data Visualization and Analysis Web Application

Developed a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize and analyze student data.
The application displays student data in two tables: one for general student information and another for student exam trends.
The general student information includes details like student name, age, course, sex, joined date, batch, subjects, student ID, phone number, and email.
The student exam trends data includes details like exam code, exam date, result, and percentage.
The application also includes a chart to visualize the student’s exam trends data. The chart is generated using Chart.js, a powerful JavaScript library for data visualization.
The chart can be updated by selecting a date and clicking a button. This feature allows users to focus on specific time periods in the student’s exam history.
This project involved a deep understanding of web development, data visualization, and data analysis. It also required proficiency in coding and the use of third-party libraries like Chart.js.
